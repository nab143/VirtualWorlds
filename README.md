# VirtualWorlds

## Project Idea 1: Solar System AR/VR

### App Description:

#### This VR app will be an addition to a Solar System AR app. The Solar System AR app allows people to view orbiting planets up close as the solar system orbits around them. With VR added, there will be an option to choose between an AR and a VR scene. The VR addition will fully immerse users into space.

#### As of now, virtual buttons give users the choice between a slow and fast orbit. The slow orbit represents the Earth’s real time orbit allowing users to be able to focus on each planet individually, while the faster paced orbit demonstrates the solar systems year-round orbit in just a few seconds.

### Current AR User Interaction:

#### This app is extremely easy for anyone to use. Users open the app, place the device camera over a flat detectable service, and turn the device horizontal to visualize the colorful solar system by turning the camera in different directions.

#### The user has two buttons displayed on the screen for choice of orbit speed. The real time orbit button is located on the bottom left side of the screen. The real time orbit is accurate to the Earth’s real yearly orbit speed, which makes it seem like all of the planets remain in one place. Although the planets are moving, very slowly, it can be an essential feature to users interested in learning about and viewing each planet individually. The speed orbit button, located on the bottom right side of the screen, drastically speeds up the solar system’s orbit. It shows one Earth orbit in under 20 seconds, which is helpful for users to learn about the solar system’s orbit and the travel of each planet around the sun.

### VR App Addition Features: 

#### The purpose of the VR feature to give users a more realistic education experience of space and the solar system. Bright colors with a starry black background will create a calming experience.

#### Users will be able to walk, or float, in space with the use of a controller, which the AR app does not have.

### Other possible features :

#### - Allowing the astronaut to transport from one planet to the next entering a new world.
#### - Using audio to relay educational information about each planet.

### Building the app:

#### The VR / AR app will be built using Unity. Steps include:
#### - Creating, downloading 3D models
#### - Animating the 3D model of an astronaut 
#### - Coding the mechanics of the astronaut to move through space
#### - Creating a space background with stars and galaxies

### Devices: #### HTC Vive
