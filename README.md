# VirtualWorlds

## Project Idea 1: Solar System AR/VR

### App Description:

#### This VR app will be an addition to a Solar System AR app. The Solar System AR app allows people to view orbiting planets up close as the solar system orbits around them. With VR added, there will be an option to choose between an AR and a VR scene. The VR addition will fully immerse users into space.



#### As of now, virtual buttons give users the choice between a slow and fast orbit. The slow orbit represents the Earthâ€™s real time orbit allowing users to be able to focus on each planet individually, while the faster paced orbit demonstrates the solar systems year-round orbit in just a few seconds.
